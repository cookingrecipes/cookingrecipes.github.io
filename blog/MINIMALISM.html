Here is how to do it, step by step.</p> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Be born.</p> <ul><li>healthy/with no disability or invalidating condition and stay like that;</li> <li>in a conflict-free area;</li> <li>in a country with free* education system;</li> <li>in a family; that provides you: safety, housing, food, access to education - at least until you are 18;</li></ul> <p>For those of you who succesfully accomplished the firs step, let's take a moment here to appreciate it. Besides the infinitely small chance for <em>you</em> to be born (which is about 1 in 10 to the power of 2,685,000), you are also amongst the luckiest people born on Earth. And this step didn't even require too much action from yourself. Yes, you are lucky! Now, look below, and see how you can also be free.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>Learn.</p> <p>You might not find your path right away or you might think that you don't know what is your passion or your dream. But that is perfectly fine. Pick something, anything, and start learning it. In the begining you might not see the bigger picture, but it will start revealing itself once you're on the way.
Focus on something that could bring value to yourself and the others. Don't think about money yet; this will only distract you from the higher purpose, which is to create, to help, to contribute - to bring value.
Don't label anything with &quot;forever&quot; and don't think too much about the future. You can learn and do so many things! Once you start somewhere, you will learn more and more and you will see your life from a different perspective everytime. Once you start knowing something, you might grow into liking the way you bring value to the world through that thing, or you might decide to go for something else. Everything is fine. Remember you are just playing around, experimenting, enjoying life.. Relax, and stop taking every decision so seriously.</p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Provide value.</p> <p>When you feel ready, start sharing your knowledge and bring your unique value to the World. Money will come by in return to the value you provide. You might decide to work a lot and earn a lot of money, or you might just take it slowly. It doesn't matter; what is important is that you can now turn your value into funding for your freedom.</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Decide what freedom means to you.</p> <p>Once you earn money, you might feel that life didn't turn out the way you expected it to be. There is always a reason for that, you just need to identify it for yourself and take action.
Maybe...</p> <ul><li>...you accepted to do a job you don't fully enjoy just because it was a good opportunity at the moment;</li> <li>...you like what you are doing but you don't have time for anything else because your schedule is too busy;</li> <li>...you are doing things you like but regularly have to deal with tasks you don't like as well</li> <li>...you have the job that you dreamed of, but doesn't bring you any satisfaction</li> <li>...you have non flexible working hours and too little holidays</li> <li>...you cannot take days off when you want</li></ul> <p>There is a solution to all that. You just need to decide what you want most. What is freedom for you? Time, money, work? What is it from your current situation that bothers you most?</p> <p>Step 5.</p> <p>Have courage.</p> <p>Changing something in life takes a lot of courage, especially if you are in a stable and secure situation. There are people all around you, who are at least as scared as you are, and that will even try to convince you not to have courage. Well, just remember that you are playing around, experimenting. There is nothing terrible that can happen in life, as long as you got yourself, as long as you are enjoying.</p> <p>Step 6.</p> <p>Save and consume less.</p> <p>Save money in order to gain independence for a certain amount of time. This will give you the freedom to make changes, to try different things. Learn to reduce your needs,</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
